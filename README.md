# Flipodoro
Flipodoro is an Android Pomodoro Timer that functions by flipping the device.

## How does it work?
When the application is opened, the app will wait until the device is flipped upside down to start the work timer. When that timer expires, the application will instruct the user to flip the device and start their break period. This will continue for 4 work/break sessions and then a long break period will begin. 

## Application state
The application is not finished, but is in a functional state. 

## Future plans
When the app is in a more finished state, I will upload to the Google Play Store.

Plan to add customization functionality (i.e. custom timers, notification sounds, etc)
Plan to add push notification capability
